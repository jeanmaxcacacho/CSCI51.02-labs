\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(Max) Given an integer \( x \), can \( x \) multiply by 19 be implemented by using shifts and adds only? How?}
    
    First we define "\( x \) multiply by 19" as the equation:
    \[
    x \cdot 19 = 19x
    \]
    Notice that 19 can be broken into a sum of 16 and 3 which allows us to rewrite the above to:
    \[
    19x = (16+3)x 
    \]
    \[
    19x = 16x + 3x
    \]
    Bit shifting manipulates numbers through powers of 2, we want to break down the expression such that we
    can express it as the sum of powers of 2. By inspection we can see that 16 is a power of 2. Using the same
    technique above we can also break down 3.
    \[
    19x = 2^4x + (2+1)x
    \]
    \[
    19x = 2^4x + 2^1x + 2^0x
    \]
    The expression \(2^0\) is just \(1\) and \(x\) multiplied by \(1\) is just \(x\), so we end up with the following:
    \[
    19x = 2^4x + 2^1x + x
    \]
    Now that we're able to represent the product as a sum of powers of 2, we can then substitute the individual products
    to their corresponding bit shifts.
    \[
    19x = (x << 4) + (x << 1) + x
    \]

    \item \textbf{(Max) What does the assembly version do? Does it use the multiply instruction?}
    
    We start by getting the assembly instructions that correspond the \emph{logic} of the dummy function.
    When a C++ source file is compiled to assembly with the g++ compiler, the assembly instructions that
    correspond to the function body is located inside the block labeled with the function's \emph{mangled name}.

    Since the function's name is \texttt{dummy}, a 5 letter string, and it takes in 1 integer parameter, instructions pertaining
    to the logic of the function body can be found inside the block labeled \texttt{\_Z5dummyi}. For the specifics of the
    GAS name mangling syntax we consulted \href{http://web.mit.edu/tibbetts/Public/inside-c/www/mangling.html}{this resource}.

    \begin{minted}{gas}
    _Z5dummyi:
    .LFB0:
        .cfi_startproc
        endbr64
        pushq	%rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
        .cfi_offset 6, -16
        movq	%rsp, %rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa_register 6
        movl	%edi, -20(%rbp)
        movl	-20(%rbp), %edx
        movl	%edx, %eax
        sall	$3, %eax
        addl	%edx, %eax
        addl	%eax, %eax
        addl	%edx, %eax
        movl	%eax, -4(%rbp)
        movl	-4(%rbp), %eax
        popq	%rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
        ret
        .cfi_endproc
    \end{minted}

    Ignoring the instructions allotted for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue_and_epilogue}{function prologue and epilogue}
    and for stack management, the arithmetic logic of the \texttt{dummy} function is contained within the lines:

    \begin{minted}{gas}
        movl	%edx, %eax
        sall	$3, %eax
        addl	%edx, %eax
        addl	%eax, %eax
        addl	%edx, %eax
        movl	%eax, -4(%rbp)
        popq	%rbp
    \end{minted}

    The value inside the \texttt{\%edx} register (the function parameter) is copied into the register \texttt{\%eax},
    where it is then shifted 3 bits to the left and stored back in the same register. \texttt{\%eax} is then incremented
    by the value inside \texttt{\%edx} which remains unchanged. Let \(x\) denote the function parameter \(x\), the value
    inside the register \texttt{\%eax} can be obtained by performing the following operations.

    \[
    \texttt{\%eax} = 0 + \texttt{\%edx} = x
    \]
    \[
    \texttt{\%eax} = x << 3 = 8x
    \]
    \[
    \texttt{\%eax} = 8x + \texttt{\%edx} = 8x + x = 9x
    \]

    At the fourth line \texttt{\%eax} is added onto itself and stored back inside \texttt{\%eax}, after which it is again
    incremented by the the value inside \texttt{\%edx} which is still just \(x\). The value inside the \texttt{\%eax} register
    is now \(19x\), the desired product.

    \[
    \texttt{\%eax} = \texttt{\%eax} + \texttt{\%eax} = 9x + 9x = 18x
    \]
    \[
    \texttt{\%eax} = 18x + \texttt{\%edx} = 18x + x = 19x
    \]

    The final lines:

    \begin{minted}{gas}
        movl	%eax, -4(%rbp)
        popq	%rbp
    \end{minted}

    \ldots copies the value stored inside \texttt{\%eax} into the base pointer to which it is then popped back to the main stack---effectively
    "returning" the value of the function.
